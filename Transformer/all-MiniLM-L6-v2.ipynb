Unlike procedural programming, \"\n        \"which focuses on functions operating on data, OOP models real-world entities as objects. \"\n        \"The four core principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. \"\n        \"Encapsulation hides internal data and exposes it through controlled interfaces, abstraction \"\n        \"focuses on essential features, inheritance enables code reuse through class hierarchies, and \"\n        \"polymorphism allows different objects to respond differently to the same method. A real-world \"\n        \"example of encapsulation is a bank account, where balance details are accessed only through \"\n        \"methods like deposit and withdraw. OOP may not be ideal for small or performance-critical \"\n        \"systems such as embedded software.\"\n    ),\n\n    \"Q2\": (\n        \"Arrays and linked lists are fundamental data structures used to store collections of elements. \"\n        \"Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing constant-time access using an \"\n        \"index, but insertions and deletions are costly because elements may need to be shifted. Linked \"\n        \"lists store elements in non-contiguous memory locations, where each node contains data and a \"\n        \"reference to the next node, making access slower due to traversal but allowing efficient \"\n        \"insertions and deletions. Arrays provide O(1) access and O(n) insertion and deletion in the \"\n        \"worst case, while linked lists provide O(n) access and O(1) insertion or deletion when the \"\n        \"position is known. A real-world example where linked lists are useful is a music playlist.\"\n    ),\n\n    \"Q3\": (\n        \"Time complexity measures how an algorithm’s running time grows as the input size increases, \"\n        \"and it is important for comparing algorithms independently of hardware. Big-O notation \"\n        \"expresses the upper bound of an algorithm’s growth rate. Linear time O(n) occurs when an \"\n        \"algorithm processes each element once, logarithmic time O(log n) appears in algorithms like \"\n        \"binary search, and quadratic time O(n^2) occurs in algorithms with nested loops such as \"\n        \"bubble sort. Worst-case analysis is preferred because it guarantees performance limits under \"\n        \"all possible input conditions.\"\n    ),\n\n    \"Q4\": (\n        \"Compiled programming languages translate source code into machine code before execution, \"\n        \"producing an executable file, while interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime \"\n        \"using an interpreter. Examples of compiled languages include C and C++, while Python and \"\n        \"JavaScript are commonly interpreted. Just-In-Time compilation, used in languages like Java, \"\n        \"combines both approaches by compiling frequently executed code segments at runtime to improve \"\n        \"performance.

Processes do \"\n        \"not share memory by default, making them safer but heavier, whereas threads share memory, \"\n        \"enabling faster communication but requiring synchronization.
