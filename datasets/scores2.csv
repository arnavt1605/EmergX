Q1,"What is Object-Oriented Programming, and how does it differ from procedural programming? Explain the four core principles of Object-Oriented Programming in your answer. Furthermore, provide a real-world example that clearly shows encapsulation or inheritance, and finally, describe a scenario where Object-Oriented Programming may not be the best design choice.","Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which combine data and behavior. Unlike procedural programming, which focuses on functions operating on data, OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects. The four core principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation ensures that an object's internal data is hidden and accessed only through well-defined interfaces. Abstraction focuses on exposing only essential features. Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and behavior from another class, and polymorphism enables different objects to respond differently to the same method call. A real-world example of encapsulation is a bank account, where balance details are hidden and accessed only through methods like deposit and withdraw. OOP may not be ideal for small, performance-critical systems such as low-level embedded software, where procedural programming can be simpler and faster.",95,0.731454743,73.14547429,50.99545301,6.892004241,80.14243529,99.60322976112366,0.0039608767110621,98.38069081306458,99.5992688844126
