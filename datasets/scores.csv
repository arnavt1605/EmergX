Q1,"What is Object-Oriented Programming, and how does it differ from procedural programming? Explain the four core principles of Object-Oriented Programming in your answer. Furthermore, provide a real-world example that clearly shows encapsulation or inheritance, and finally, describe a scenario where Object-Oriented Programming may not be the best design choice.","Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which combine data and behavior. Unlike procedural programming, which focuses on functions operating on data, OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects. The four core principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation ensures that an object's internal data is hidden and accessed only through well-defined interfaces. Abstraction focuses on exposing only essential features. Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and behavior from another class, and polymorphism enables different objects to respond differently to the same method call. A real-world example of encapsulation is a bank account, where balance details are hidden and accessed only through methods like deposit and withdraw. OOP may not be ideal for small, performance-critical systems such as low-level embedded software, where procedural programming can be simpler and faster.",95,0.7314547428508448,73.14547428508448,50.99545301358401,6.892004241081196,80.14243528834382

Q9,"What happens when a user types a URL into a web browser and presses Enter? Describe the role of DNS in this process, explain how TCP/IP is used to establish communication between the client and server, and discuss where and how HTTPS encryption is applied during this interaction.","When a user types a URL into a browser and presses Enter, the browser first checks if the domain name is already cached. If not, it sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name into an IP address. Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a connection with the server using the TCP/IP protocol through a three-way handshake. After the connection is established, an HTTPS request is sent, during which TLS encryption is negotiated to secure the communication. The server then processes the request and sends back an encrypted response, which the browser decrypts and renders as a web page. HTTPS ensures data confidentiality and integrity throughout this exchange.",97,0.4121965965395673,41.21965965395673,11.163842975692791,59.54083662419761,68.36120440714136

Explain the main phases of the SDLC, compare the traditional waterfall and agile development models, and discuss reasons for choosing one model over the other.","The Software Development Lifecycle is a structured approach used to plan, build, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. The main phases typically include requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The waterfall model follows these phases sequentially, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next, making it suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements. Agile development, on the other hand, is iterative and incremental, focusing on continuous feedback, frequent releases, and close collaboration with stakeholders. Agile is preferred when requirements are likely to change, such as in product-based or startup environments, while waterfall is often chosen for regulated or contract-based projects where changes are costly.",98,0.4341475988166287,43.41475988166288,22.4396373898008,74.67885714197493,65.36374746017103
